# Rice Type Classification with PyTorch! üçöüî¨

This project uses a computer program (specifically, something called a "neural network" built with PyTorch) to figure out what kind of rice it's looking at.  It's like teaching a computer to tell the difference between different types of rice grains, just by looking at their shape and size!

## What's Inside? üóÇÔ∏è

*   **`Tabular_Classification.ipynb`**:  This is the main file, which is a "notebook" that contains all the instructions for the computer. It's like a recipe that tells the computer exactly what to do, step by step, to learn about rice.

## How Does It Work? ü§î (Kid-Friendly Explanation)

Imagine you have a bunch of different toys, like cars, dolls, and blocks.  You want to teach a computer to recognize them.

1.  **Show Lots of Examples:** You show the computer lots and lots of pictures of each toy and tell it what each one is. "This is a car! This is a doll! This is a block!"

2.  **The Computer Learns Patterns:** The computer looks for patterns.  "Cars are usually red and have wheels. Dolls have hair and wear clothes. Blocks are square."

3.  **Testing Time:**  Then, you show the computer a brand new toy it's never seen before.  The computer tries to guess what it is based on the patterns it learned.  If it guesses right, it gets a "good job!"  If it guesses wrong, you tell it the right answer, and it learns from its mistake.

This project does the same thing, but with rice! The computer looks at things like how long the rice grain is, how wide it is, and its shape to guess what type of rice it is.

## How to Use It (Easy Steps) üíª

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *download or clone this repository to your local machine.*
2.  **Install the necessary libraries:**
   *open your terminal or anaconda prompt and navigate to your downloaded or cloned folder location and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`*

3.  **Open the "Recipe Book":**
    *   Open `Tabular_Classification.ipynb` using **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or similar tool.  Think of this as opening the "recipe book" for the computer.

4.  **Run the Instructions:**
    *   Inside the notebook, you need to "run" each step (each "cell").  There's usually a "Run" button or a keyboard shortcut (like Shift+Enter) to do this.
    *   The computer will follow the instructions in the notebook, and you'll see it learning about rice!

##  Explanation for All Ages:

This project uses PyTorch, a powerful library for building neural networks, to classify rice types based on their physical characteristics. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    *   The code downloads the rice classification dataset from Kaggle. For this it needs the appropriate credentials.
    *   It loads the dataset using Pandas (`riceClassification.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
    *   It preprocesses the data by normalizing the numerical features to a range between 0 and 1. Normalization helps improve the performance of the neural network.

2.  **Data Splitting**:
    *   The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using `train_test_split`. The standard split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
    *   The training set is used to train the model. The validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

3.  **Dataset and DataLoader Creation**:
    *   A custom `dataset` class is created to load the data in a format suitable for PyTorch.
    *   `DataLoader` objects are created for the training, validation, and test datasets. These data loaders provide batches of data to the model during training and evaluation.

4.  **Model Definition**:
    *   A simple neural network (`MyModel` class) is defined using `torch.nn`. The network consists of an input layer, a ReLU activation function, a linear layer, and a sigmoid output layer.
    *   The model architecture is designed to classify the rice types based on the input features.

5.  **Model Training**:
    *   The model is trained using the training data and evaluated on the validation data.
    *   The `BCELoss` (Binary Cross-Entropy Loss) is used as the loss function, and the `Adam` optimizer is used to update the model's parameters.
    *   The training loop iterates over the epochs and batches of data. In each iteration, the model makes predictions, calculates the loss, and updates the parameters using backpropagation.

6.  **Model Evaluation**:
    *   After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to measure its performance.
    *   The accuracy score is calculated and printed to show how well the model performs on unseen data.

## Libraries Used üìö

*   **PyTorch**: The main framework for building the neural network.
*   **pandas**: For reading and processing the data from the CSV file.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
*   **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and for calculating the accuracy.
*   **matplotlib**: For plotting the training progress (optional).
*   **opendatasets**: for downloading the dataset directly form kaggle.
