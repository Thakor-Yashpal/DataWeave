# Rice Type Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch-based model for classifying rice types using tabular data.  It demonstrates a basic neural network implementation and training process.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and understandable example of tabular classification using PyTorch. It covers:

*   **Data Loading:**  Loads the rice classification dataset from Kaggle using `opendatasets`.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data cleaning (handling missing values), feature normalization (min-max scaling), and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
*   **Model Definition:**  A simple feedforward neural network (`MyModel`) built with `torch.nn.Linear`, `torch.nn.ReLU`, and `torch.nn.Sigmoid`.
*   **Training Loop:**  Implements a basic training loop with binary cross-entropy loss (`nn.BCELoss`) and Adam optimization.
*   **Evaluation:**  Evaluates the trained model on the test set and reports the accuracy.
*   **CUDA Support:** Automatically detects and utilizes CUDA (GPU) if available for faster training and inference.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.7+
    *   PyTorch (install with `pip install torch`)
    *   opendatasets (install with `pip install opendatasets`)
    *   pandas (install with `pip install pandas`)
    *   scikit-learn (install with `pip install scikit-learn`)
    *   torchsummary (install with `pip install torchsummary`)
    *   matplotlib (install with `pip install matplotlib`)
2.  **Installation:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Thakor-Yashpal/DataWeave]
    cd [Thakor-Yashpal/DataWeave]
    ```
3.  **Usage:**

    To run the training script:

    ```bash
    python tabular_classification.py
    ```

    The script will:

    *   Download the rice classification dataset from Kaggle.
    *   Preprocess the data.
    *   Train the neural network.
    *   Evaluate the model on the test set.
    *   Print the test accuracy.

## Code Structure

*   `tabular_classification.py`: The main script containing the data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training loop, and evaluation code.

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)

I plan to expand upon this project with the following enhancements in the coming weeks:

1.  **Improved Model Architecture:** Experimenting with more complex neural network architectures (e.g., adding more layers, dropout, batch normalization).
2.  **Enhanced Data Preprocessing:** Implementing techniques like standardization (using `StandardScaler` instead of min-max), one-hot encoding for categorical features (if applicable), and advanced missing value imputation.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizing techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the model's hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.).
4.  **Regularization:** Implementing L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
5.  **More Comprehensive Evaluation:**  Exploring additional evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score, AUC) and generating confusion matrices.
6.  **Visualizations:**  Adding visualizations to the training process (e.g., plotting training/validation loss and accuracy curves) using Matplotlib.
7.  **Experiment Tracking:** Integrating experiment tracking tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases to manage and compare different experiments.
8.  **Saving and Loading Models:** Implementing functionality to save trained models using `torch.save` and load them later for inference using `torch.load`.
9.  **Explainable AI (XAI):** Exploring techniques for understanding and explaining the model's predictions (e.g., feature importance).
10. **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):** Exploring AutoML tools to automated machine learning and hyperparameter tuning
